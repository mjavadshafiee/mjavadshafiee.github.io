        <p>Random fields have remained a topic of great interest for decades for the purpose of structured
		inference, especially for problems such as image segmentation.  The local nodal interactions commonly
		used in such models often suffer the short-boundary bias problem, which are tackled primarily through 
		the incorporation of long-range nodal interactions. However, the issue of computational tractability 
		becomes a significant issue when incorporating such long-range nodal interactions, particularly when 
		a large number of long-range nodal interactions (e.g., fully-connected random fields) are modeled.
		In this work, we introduce a new random field formation framework, called randomly-formed conditional 
		random fields (RCRFs), which is aimed at tackling the issue of computational tractability when using 
		fully-connected random fields.  Grounded in random graph theory, a fully-connected random field is modeled
		as a random graph, and the sparse representation of the random field is formed stochastically as 
		realizations of the random graph.  The proposed RCRF allows for efficient structured inference 
		using fully-connected random fields while preserving modeling accuracy as well as relaxes restrictions 
		on the types of potential functions that can be utilized. Experimental results demonstrate that
		the proposed framework can provide competitive performance for the purpose of figure-ground segmentation
		when compared to existing fully-connected and principled deep random field frameworks while requiring
		only a modest run-time.</p>

			<p>SFCRF was shown to provide significant improvements in segmentation
			accuracy, there were still limitations with the preservation
			of fine structure boundaries. To address these limitations,
			we propose a new approach to stochastic clique formation
			for fully connected random fields (G-SFCRF) that is guided
			by the structural characteristics of different nodes within the
			random field. In particular, fine structures surrounding a node
			are modeled statistically by probability distributions, and
			stochastic cliques are formed by considering the statistical
			similarities between nodes within the random fields. 
			Experimental results show that G-SFCRF outperforms existing fully
			connected CRF frameworks, SFCRF, and the principled deep
			random field framework for image segmentation.</p>

			<p>While the computational complexity of the inference
			process is greatly reduced, the computational complexity
			of forming stochastic cliques is relatively high, 
			thus resulting in a relatively higher overall computational complexity
			compared to the first direction. Second, to reduce the computational 
			complexity of forming stochastic cliques, a weak
			spatial proximity is imposed when forming the stochastic
			cliques, in which nodal interactions are formed with decreasing 
			probability with increasing spatial distance. <br>
			we are inspired by fundamental work in graph sampling and random graph theory where it
			was shown theoretically that a dense graph may be greatly
			sparsified while retaining informational content by treating
			the dense graph as a random graph. In the proposed framework,
			which we will call randomly-formed conditional random fields (RCRF),
			a fully-connected random field is modeled as a random graph and 
			sparse representations of the random field are formed stochastically 
			as realizations of the random graph. The randomly-formed conditional random
			field is globally sparse with a strong balance of local and
			long-range relationships that retain informational content and
			as such retain the modeling power of the fully-connected
			random field.<br>
			Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can 
			provide competitive performance for the purpose of figure-ground 
			segmentation when compared to existing fully-connected and
			principled deep random field frameworks while requiring
			only a modest run-time.
